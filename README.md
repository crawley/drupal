Overview

Status / Planned features
-------------------------

* I'm currently developing / testing at home on a vagrant virtual running 
  ubuntu 14.04.
* When the base recipes are working, next cab off the rank will be AAF 
  enablement.
* Then, maybe, see about generic support for Drupal "distributions", "modules"
  and "themes".
